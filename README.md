# Its All About Me

## Description

This project portfolio was created using the JavaScript library React to produce a single page application. There are four sections; About Me where I have written a short introduction about myself; a Portfolio section that provides links to 6 applications that I have created since starting my web development journey; a Contact form where you can reach out if you would like to know more and finally a Resume page which summarises my skill set and provides a link to download my Resume.
